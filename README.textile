h1. Robots.txt Examples

h2. Fend off those pesky robots!

This project resulted from having to specifically block useless bots that requests thousands of pages
per day and send no traffic. Several example bots files are included that could be renamed and copied to 
robots.txt in the root of your web application. Your robots file should be accessible at
http://www.yourdomain.com/robots.txt

I have seen sites that had multiple servers just to handle excessive bot load.

Files included

robots.txt              Standard bot file should be usable for most sites. 
                        Only disallows know bad bots.

robots.major.txt        Has a white-list for major search engine and blocks 
                        everything else

robots.noarchive.txt    same as above but disallows archive.org bot which uses 
                        lots of traffic and doesn't send much traffic

robots.wordpress.txt    Entries for Wordpress blogs

robots.none.txt         Block all bots
